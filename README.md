# Ensuring Food Safety Using Blockchain

The main logic of blockchain is in [blockchain.py](/blockchain.py)

We made an API with various functionalities for blockchain ia as mentioned in [blockchain.py](/blockchain.py). The API is built using Flask and you can test the API requests using Postman.

To run and test it:

* download this repo locally

* run [winCoin.py](/winCoin.py) in terminal           (host= '0.0.0.0', port= 5000)

* run [winCoin1.py](/winCoin1.py) in separate terminal (host= '0.0.0.0', port= 5001)

* run [winCoin2.py](/winCoin2.py) in separate terminal (host= '0.0.0.0', port= 5002)

* & so on for as many nodes as you want

* now open Postman

* make requests accordingly from [blockchain.py](/blockchain.py) file

the POST request format for adding nodes is in [nodes.json](/nodes.json)
& for adding transactions is in [transaction.json](/transaction.json)

**NOTE** : *It is a college project, for further information refer* [Project Report](/Report.pdf)
